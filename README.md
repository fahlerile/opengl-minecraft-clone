# Exit codes

- `1` - Failed to initialize GLFW
- `2` - Failed to initialize GLEW
- `3` - Failed to create a window

# TODO

- `blocks` vector -> map (vec(pos) : texture)
- Add `load_resources`
- Render a chunk of blocks
- Think about optimisation (don't render vertices that are can't be seen by a player right now)
